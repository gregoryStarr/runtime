This project Has been on my radar for a bvit and this gave me a chance to put some time to it finally

## Typical Setup

In the project directory, you can run the following commonds n the 'client' dir

### `npm start`
### `npm test`

I have some sanithy tests on the server, biut nothing =close to good cocvewrage 
### `npm run build`


### Module federation notes
I did start down the road to federating this app but by the time I got to it I feared risking my deadline. but thats is what you will find in the 'host' directory 


### `The server`
I dont havew this hosted in the wild yet so, you will need to run it locally. like so:
### `node index.js`
```
$
